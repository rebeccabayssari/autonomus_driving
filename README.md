# Reinforcement Learning Project – Mention IA 2024/2025  

##  Project Overview  
This project was developed as part of the *Reinforcement Learning – Mention IA 2024/2025* course.  
It explores different RL algorithms in discrete and continuous action settings, focusing on the `highway-env` library.  

The work is divided into four main tasks:  
1. **Task 1** – Implementing a DQN agent from scratch.  
2. **Task 2** – Continuous actions: custom implementation (DDPG, TD3, PPO).  
3. **Task 3** – Stable-Baselines implementation on a new environment (`parking-v0`).  
4. **Task 4** – Extra experiment: impact of hyperparameters on SAC + HER.
